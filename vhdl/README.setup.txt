These are all the VHDL files of the fly-n-shoot game.

Basic steps to run the game, using just the DE1-SoC FPGA board:

1) Create new Quartus II project and add all VHDL files
2) Regenerate using the MegaWizard subtool the PLL in VHDL, called "my_altpll"
3) Copy the pin-assignments from provided .qsf file to your .qsf file generated by Quartus
4) Run Synthesis and Place & Route for the design
5) Generate programming file
6) Upload bistream .sof file to the board to configure the FPGA
7) Connect VGA monitor to DE1-SoC board
8) Play the game using KEY0, KEY1, and KEY2 push-buttons
9) (Optional) If you have a NES CONTROLLER (NC), then connect it to the 
   GPIO_1 connector of the DE1-SoC board as shown below:
   
                           ...
Red wire of NC <---- VCC--|o o|--GND,                ----> White wire of NC
                          |o o|--CLOCK, PIN_AJ22:D27 ----> Green wire of NC
                          |o o|--LATCH, PIN_AG22:D29 ----> Yellow wire of NC
                          |o o|--DATA,  PIN_AF23:D31 ----> Black wire of NC
                          |o o|
                          |o o|
                           --- 

The pins of the actual NES CONTROLLER that I got have these wire colors:

                          +----> Power  (Red)
                          |
                5 +---------+ 7
                  | x  x  o   \
                  | o  o  o  o |
                4 +------------+ 1
                    |  |  |  |
                    |  |  |  +-> Ground (White)
                    |  |  +----> Clock  (Green)
                    |  +-------> Latch  (Yellow)
                    +----------> Data   (Black)
